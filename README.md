### Sprint 4 Goals

The primary focus of Sprint 4 is to introduce user authentication features to enhance the overall user experience. Below are the key features and tasks planned for this sprint:

1. Sign Up Component:

    - Create a Sign Up component that allows users to register for an account.
    - Implement a form with the following fields:
        - First Name
        - Last Name
        - Email
        - Password
        - URL of the Photo
        - Country (selectable from a dropdown menu).
    - Provide an option for users to register using their Google account.

2. Sign In Component:

    - Develop a component that displays itineraries specific to the selected city.
        - Develop a Sign In component that enables users to log into their accounts.
        - Implement a form where users can enter their email and password.
        - Include an option for users to log in using their Google account.
3. Sign Out Functionality:
        - Implement a Sign Out action that allows users to log out of the application.

## Additional Requirements

- Ensure that the Sign Up and Sign In components are user-friendly, with proper input validation and error handling.
- Design the user interface for these components to align with the existing MyTinerary style.
- Implement user sessions and authentication state management to control access to certain parts of the application based on user authentication status.
