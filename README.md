## MVC for Sprint 3

### Sprint 3 Goals

The primary focus of Sprint 3 is to further enhance the user experience by implementing city-specific itineraries. Below are the key features and tasks planned for this sprint:

1. City Selection Enhancement:

    - Improve the city selection process.
    - Ensure that clicking on a city in the "Cities" section correctly identifies the chosen city.
    - Navigate to a detailed view component for the selected city.

2. City Itinerary Component:

    - Develop a component that displays itineraries specific to the selected city.
    - Display the following information for each itinerary:
        - Photo and name of the person who published it.
        - Price: Represented visually with a numeric value from 1 to 5 (small bills or an allusive icon).
        - Duration: Indicate the number of hours the itinerary lasts.
        - Likes count (default to 0).
        - Display 3 or 4 thematic hashtags.
        - Include a "view more" button that, for now, indicates "under construction."

3. Backend Integration:

   - Communicate with the backend to fetch city-specific itineraries.
   - Ensure proper data retrieval and rendering in the City Itinerary Component.
