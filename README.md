# MyTinerary Frontend - Sprint 2

Welcome to MyTinerary! This bootcamp project is aimed at providing an intuitive, agile, and accessible user experience for travelers looking to find their perfect trip, designed by insiders who know and love their cities. This README.md file contains information about the goals and minimum requirements set for Sprint 2 of the development process.

## MVC for Sprint 2

### Sprint 2 Goals

The primary focus of Sprint 2 is to develop the Cities component and enhance the overall user experience. The following features and tasks are planned for this sprint:

1. Cities Component Development:

    - Implement the frontend component for displaying cities.
    - Dynamically fetch city data from the API to populate the list.
    - Incorporate an input field that allows users to filter cities based on their preferences.
    - The filtering should consider case-insensitive search and handle leading/trailing spaces.
    - Display a friendly message when no cities match the search criteria.
    - Enable clicking on a city to navigate to a detailed view.

2. City Detailed View:

    - Create a reusable component for displaying detailed information about a city.
    - Show the city's name and photo at the top.
    - Provide a "Under Construction" section for future itineraries and activities.

3. Backend Setup:

    - Develop the server to handle API requests.
    - Set up a database to store city information.
    - Create a "cities" collection in the database.
    - Design the City model with properties such as name, photo link, and country.
    - Implement routes and controllers for loading, getting all, getting by ID, modifying, and deleting cities.
    - Ensure the backend is functional for interactions with tools like Insomnia/Postman.
