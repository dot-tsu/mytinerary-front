# MyTinerary - Sprint 1

Welcome to MyTinerary! This bootcamp project is aimed at providing an intuitive, agile, and accessible user experience for travelers looking to find their perfect trip, designed by insiders who know and love their cities. This README.md file contains information about the accomplishments and minimum requirements achieved during Sprint 1 of the development process.

## MVC for Sprint 1

### Minimum Requirements

The following features were implemented during Sprint 1:

1. Home Page - Responsive and Intuitive UI:

    - The MyTinerary home page is fully responsive and provides an intuitive user experience at all resolutions.
    - The header contains a side menu with options, including an optional logo and application name.
    - The header includes a fake login button, when clicked logs in.
    - The header includes a generic user image, indicating that no one is logged in.
    - The links and image in the header do not lead anywhere or perform any action, except for the "Cities" link.
    - The "Cities" link is functional and redirects the user to an empty page.

2. Hero/Welcome Section:

    - The hero/welcome section displays the name of the MyTinerary app and the slogan: "Find your perfect trip, designed by insiders who know and love their cities!"

3. Call to Action:

    - The home page includes an eye-catching call to action, inviting users to click and access the "Cities" page.
    - The call to action is visually complemented with images and animations to make it attractive and engaging.

4. Footer:

    - The footer recaps the information about the site.
    - It contains another navigation menu to ease user navigation.
    - Additional information such as address, social networks, and a map can be found in the footer, as per the design.
